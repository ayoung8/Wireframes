<a id="B7"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>The following 5-year IT Plan describes how the Health Products and Food Branch (HPFB) proposes to meet the information technology goals of the fiscal years 2017-18 through 2021-22. The plan includes HPFB’s proposed approach for enhancing business processes, data quality and consistency, supporting technologies, and IT operations in pursuit of an efficient, interconnected and adaptable organization with improved processes, structures and systems that support its programs to excel in meeting our objectives. 
</p><p>HPFB mandate is to take an integrated approach to managing the health-related risks and benefits of health products and food by:</p>
<ul><li>Minimizing health risk factors to Canadians, while maximizing the safety provided by the regulatory system for health products and food.
</li><li>Promoting conditions that enable Canadians to make healthy choices and providing information so that they can make informed decisions about their health.
</li></ul>
<p>HPFB uses information in this plan for resourcing and to implement the necessary IT changes to enable efficient and consistent adoption of the data standardization, technical architecture, and informatics changes. The plan considers assumptions, available resources, and legislative requirements of the e-Prescribing / Pan Canadian Drug Information System (PCDIS) (Accord) Transformation Initiative. The plan relies on the development and acceptance of regulatory data standards, and other global harmonization initiatives, such as the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).</p>

<a id="B9"><h3>Vision</h3></a>
<p>HPFB’s vision is that all Canadians achieve optimal health outcomes through access to safe, effective, high quality health products and food, and timely, relevant and useful health information. <a href="#fnb1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
</p><p>To achieve this vision, IT investments must be aligned with HPFB’s program inventory and address all business needs pertaining to data, application, technical, security, and performance. As well, modernize HPFB’s regulatory activities across the entire product lifecycle and each product line. 
</p>
<a id="B10"><h3>HPFB IT Plan Context</h3></a>
<p><img src="images/wireframes/hpfb_it/files/img1.png"></p>

</li><li>Increasing use of mobile devices and other internet enabled devices that can network and communicate with each other
</li></ul>
<a id="B12"><h3>KEY INVESTMENT CHALLENGES</h3></a>
<p>The Health Product and Food Branch recognizes that regulating health products continues to be a globalized business linking regulators, suppliers, patients, and consumers. As the Branch moves towards regulatory regime modernization between 2017-2021, 2017-18 becomes a crucial transition period setting the stage for realizing big data and globalization-driven architectural improvements that have been the principle investment focus since 2015. 
</p><p>In 2017-18, there are six key IT investment challenges facing HPFB
</p><ol><li>Completion of ministerial requirements of the 2015-2018 blueprint (e.g. Healthy Eating);
</li><li>Provisioning of new Regulatory requirements required in FY 2017-18 (e.g. CETA);
</li><li>Establishing the groundwork for e-Prescribing / Pan Canadian Drug Information System (PCDIS) (Accord) Transformation; 
</li><li>Enhancing and sustaining business operational activities;
</li><li>Continuing support for regulatory transparency and openness; and
</li><li>Mitigation of Aging IT risk.
</li></ol>
<p>Since the publication of the 2016-17 HPFB IM/IT framework strategy was published, the Branch has been faced with increasing challenges to health product regulation. Among the new challenges are three primary e-Prescribing / Pan Canadian Drug Information System (PCDIS) (Accord) Transformation provisions advancing the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs: pharma workflow, e-prescribing, and pan-Canadian drug information. Over the next 5 years the e-Prescribing / Pan Canadian Drug Information System (PCDIS) (Accord) Transformation Initiative will form the cornerstone of policy, regulatory, and business transformation in the methodologies that Health Canada will use to manage therapeutic products (drugs and medical devices) into the 2020s. 
</p><p>At the same time, the Branch cannot lose sight of the business operational gains achieved, and provisioned for, in its transformation from a predominantly domestically-focused agency operating in a globalized economy, to a modern public health regulatory agency fully prepared to function well in a complex globalized regulatory environment. Structured information exchange, and the ability to effectively manage big data, is a critical component in extending regulatory reach with a view towards both increasing integrations amongst all industry partners and accelerating collaboration, work sharing, and transparency.
</p>
<a id="B13"><h3>GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT</h3></a>
<p>HPFB has robust governance in place to ensure the alignment of IT investments with Health Canada commitments. Within the Branch, the Brach Executive Sub-Committee on Transforming, Transparency, Investment and Finance (BEC-TIFF) provides oversight of HPFB commitments and resource allocation in support of IT investment projects. BEC-TIFF recommends, evaluates, prioritizes, and controls the proposed IT investments decisions.
</p><p>As part of the overall governance process, Resource Management &amp; Operations Directorate (RMOD) monitors performance and risks associated with each IT investment and works closely with stakeholders to ensure these investments support Health Canada objectives, including reuse of common IM/IT business processes, shared best practices, and employment of common authoritative data sources. 
</p>
<a id="C7"><h2>Principles</h2></a>
        <p>This IT Plan builds upon earlier initiatives and compliments the Branch’s <em>Regulatory Roadmap for Health Products and Food</em><a href="#fnb2"><sup>2</sup> strategy to Canadians.  
</p><p>While aiming for comprehensive enablement of all regulatory activities for food and health products, emphasis will be placed upon IT investments that are <strong>practical</strong>, <strong>measurable</strong>, and <strong>achievable</strong> and deliver:
</p><ul><li>clear value to Canadians and the health care and food safety systems; and
</li><li>the greatest efficiency by cutting through unsustainable information technology systems and replacing them with ones drawing upon international partnering, best practices and new technological advantages to contribute directly to the safety of food and health products.
</li></ul><p>The following six key strategic principles will guide HPFB’s information technology investment decisions.</p>
<a id="C8"><h3>COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL DATA STANDARDS</h3></a>
<p>Health Canada follows an open, consensus-based process to develop and maintain data standards. Open, consensus-based data standards are necessary to integrate, analyze, report, and share regulatory information. Health Canada’s standards development and maintenance program aligns with three principles:</p>
<ol><li>Ensure the use of high-quality data standards through the use of voluntary, consensus-based standards development processes in accredited standards development organizations (SDO) in place of government-unique standards unless such standards are inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical.
</li><li>Reduce the regulatory burden through alignment with existing health IT initiatives, laws, regulations, and mandates such as Executive Orders.
</li><li>Ensure the efficient use of data standards by adopting or adapting standards currently in use, where feasible.
</li></ol>
        <p>HPFB collaborates with stakeholders (e.g., regulated industry, SDOs, academia, and medical-clinical societies, as well as other government agencies) to develop new and refine existing data standards. Health Canada is committed to the consistent use of data standards in regulatory submissions and plans to develop a set of metrics to assess their impact on the efficiency of the review process. Further, HPFB will develop a mechanism for the tracking and reporting of the number of submissions that comply and fail to comply with Health Canada-supported standards.
</p><p>HPFB has promoted and encouraged the submission of data in standard, electronic formats thereby enabling efficient and effective process of reviewing drug marketing applications, safety reports, and other regulatory functions requiring data. 
</p>
<a id="C9"><h3>COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL DATA STANDARDS</h3></a>
<p>HPFB plans to strengthen the use of “fit-for-purpose” support models for proven enterprise class applications, such as docubridge and ARISg (Canada Vigilance). These applications have been critical to the success of HPFB’s evaluation, compliance, and risk assessment initiatives. For example, HPFB has been working with the US FDA through the FDA Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) to enable Health Canada to use the electronic submission gateway (CESG) to receive regulatory submissions.</p>
<p>The ability of proven enterprise class applications to remain stable and meet HPFB’s projected future submission volume increases is key to ensuring adequacy of capacity and planning capabilities, contingency planning, long-term viability, and continuity of operations.</p>
<a id="C10"><h3>INTEGRATED SYSTEM APPROACH</h3></a>
<p>Fully integrated business systems provide benefits across the entire organisation. An integrated system approach implies that HPFB works collaboratively with each informatics systems aligned towards a single goal: improving the performance of the entire organization. An integrated business systems approach provides a clear, uniform image of the entire HPFB organization, our regulatory activities, how those activities inter-relate, and any associated risks. Efficiency is gained from reduced duplication, and making it easier to adopt new systems in the future.
</p><p>Key benefits include
</p>
<ul>
<p><strong>Real Time Data</strong> - Through an integrated information system all of the data is up to date. This is essential for all elements of the organisation ranging from marketing, communications through to finance.
</p><p><strong>Data Veracity </strong>- Team members will be able to communicate better by having exactly the same information available to them at each time. Its saves data mismatches between systems and departments.
</p><p><strong>Reduced Risk of Errors </strong>- a reduction in replicated data will in turn reduce human errors enhancing accuracy of available information.
</p><p><strong>Enhanced Productivity</strong> – More FTE-time devoted to business value-add tasks rather than replicating data and avoiding delays in receiving information from other business units
</p>
</ul>
<a id="C11"><h3>COMMON DATA ARCHITECTURE</h3></a>
<p>Common Data Architecture will enhance data processing operations through optimal data flow in the system. The design process encapsulates: conceptualization, which takes care of representing business entities; logical representation, which handles the formation of logic on how entities are related; and physical implementation, the realization of data mechanisms to specific business functionalities.
</p><p>Common Data Architectures answer these basic questions:
</p><ol><li>How is data stored for persistence?
</li><li>How do components and processes reference and manipulate business data?
</li><li>How do external and legacy systems access the data?
</li><li>How will the interfaces to manage data by external and legacy systems be designed?
</li><li>How will common data operations be implemented?
</li></ol>
<p>A common data architecture helps prevent commons mistakes such as a lack of context (making the data too generic), reduction in the amount of unmanaged data sources, having too much data not available to support governance or transparency, not applying a consistent methodology towards data integration, and establishing too much context on the finished product (rush to delivery) at the expense of effective data management.<a href="#fnb3"><sup>3</sup></p>
<a id="C12"><h3>INNOVATION</h3></a>
<p>Our transformation process is contingent on a key commitment to work openly, transparently and meaningfully with Canadians, stakeholders and international partners in the development, improvement and implementation of the plan for modernization. IT investments should support an “Anywhere, Anytime, with Anyone” philosophy that encourages integration across the global health products supply chain, international regulators, provincial and territorial health ministries, healthcare practitioners and institutions, and Canadians at large. Partnering must occur to regulate food and health products in a sustainable way, given the international nature of the food and health product industries and their increasingly complicated global supply chains.</p>
<p><font color="#800080">Our transformation process is also being informed by a commitment from the Privy Council Office toward a well-supported government in developing new ways to involve Canadians directly in issues directly impacting healthcare. The Government has asked ministers to devote a fixed percentage of program funds to experimenting with new approaches aimed at instilling a culture of measurement, evaluation and innovation, in program and policy design and delivery. As part of Procurement Modernization, Health Canada is collaborating with other government departments to simplify the process for low dollar value purchases. HPFB will test the effectiveness of a new approach that seeks to reduce the time spent on low dollar value contracts while increasing the reliability of the system. This experimental approach will be used to phase in government-wide implementation. The ultimate goal is to reduce the administrative burden and improve results for Canadian businesses and the government<a href="#fnb4"><sup>4</sup>.
</p><p>The health care industry is slowly coming to grips with new and innovative business models, increased use of validated and shared health care data, networked availability of doctors through online platforms, the increased use of software as a medical device, the use of artificial intelligence systems to improve accuracy of diagnoses and customize treatment, wearable technology to monitor lifestyle habits and health conditions, and so much more<a href="#fnb5"><sup>5</sup>. Beyond this are additional concerns related to hybrid products that are treated differently under the regulations depending on how they are classified such as is the case with some self-care products. For example, depending on its use, its ingredients, and the claims made about it, a simple sunscreen can be regulated as a natural health product, a non-prescription medication or a cosmetic.

<a id="C13"><h3>ENABLE THE REGULATORY TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS FRAMEWORK</h3></a>
<p>The Government of Canada is making more data and information available to Canadians than ever before. Canadians are also being offered more opportunities to participate in discussions on government policies and priorities. As a regulator, Health Canada plays an important role in protecting the health and safety of Canadians and is committed to greater transparency and openness to further strengthen trust in our regulatory decisions. The Framework outlines concrete steps Health Canada is taking to improve access to timely, useful and relevant health and safety information.
</p><p>The RTOF Framework will: 
</p><ul><li>Help Canadians to better understand how and why our decisions are made. Thereby actively contributing to well-informed decisions on their health and the health of their families.
</li><li>Assist industry to be better positioned to comply with current regulatory requirements and plan for upcoming regulatory changes.<a href="#fnb8"><sup>8</sup>
</li></ul><p>HPFB promotes the investment in tools which enable the Regulatory Transparency and Openness Framework as an integral part of our regulatory decision making and publication process.</p>
